              We started as a small family bakery with a passion for creating the perfect macaron. 
              Every batch is made by hand using traditional French techniques and the finest ingredients 
              sourced from local suppliers.
            </p>
            <p className="about-description">
              Our commitment to quality and attention to detail has made us a favorite among 
              macaron lovers in the community. We believe that every bite should be a moment 
              of pure joy and indulgence.
